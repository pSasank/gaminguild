Hey There,
Interested in joining us in our journey?
We can't offer you cubicles (which most of you hate to be in), corporate benefits (most of which aren't useful) or any fancy pay(which you actually might like - but we can't afford right now).
All we could promise is -
Give you complete creative freedom and time for development.
Buy you an occasional beer after a nice code push.
Watch parties on big cricket / football finals.
Sit down and discuss not only project updates but also any new awesome web series.
Moderate paycheque reflecting your contributions.
Flexible work timings and remote working (We really encourage it).

Employees willbe treated as an integral part of the company and will grow as the company grows.
Shoot an email with your resume and some bio and how you think you can help us. Come on! we need you more than your current employers.
