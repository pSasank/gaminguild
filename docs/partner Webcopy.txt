Let's face it - Everything in the world needs some love and some money.
Though Gaminguild has started out as our labour of love and we were more than happy to spend our time and money building and maintaining it, We still needed more people to work on projects - designers, writers, testers etc and they need some tools to work with, some place to work at and some pay to work for.
Bottomline - We have licences to purchase, bills to pay, lunches to buy.
We are looking for some partners in this endeavor. And we are not just looking for some cash cows who'd be willing to sprinkle the green.
We need a partner who'd stand by us as a rock, celebrate with us as a friend, who'd belive and involve in the project as much as we do.
