The world is changing at a fast pace. Keeping aside the political and economic aspects, IT sector has always been something where change is inevitable every few years. Technologies keep evolving but for humans to keep themselves updated is no easy task. Especially when it involves hours of reading some plain text tutorial. 
That's what drove us towards gaminguild.. to make learning fun again.
Our purpose was to make learning enjoyable. Like it does in kindergaden. And soon enough gaminguild become the core of our vision. It is the kind somthing that we wanted to do when we started TotalWeb. We just didn't know it yet.
To make gaminguild a reality, we decided it should be more than the side projects. in fact more than any other project.
that's when the decision to rebrand TotalWeb has been taken. While the existing projects will be supported and new projects taken on a selective basis, Gaminguild remains the centre of our focus.
